			<h5>A new language school to be opened </h5>

In the nearest future I would like to start studying Swedish. If you are looking for a well-educated, experienced teacher, do not hesistate and get in contact with me by sending an e-mail.</p></div>

			<h5>Experience and education</h5>
			<p>I have graduated in teaching German and English. I have also a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Environmental Protection and Management and a Master of Arts degree in Management. For many years I have been teaching children and adults. Currently I am teaching at the weekends only as I work also as a HR Executive in one of the multinational companies.
			I can prepare you for exams, work abroad or simply be a partner in business negotiations. During my classes you will improve your speaking, listening, reading and writing skills.</p>
